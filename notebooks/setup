1️⃣ Install Python & Jupyter Notebook
Why: You need Python for cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Steps:

1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
2. Download Anaconda Individual Edition (includes Python + Jupyter Notebook + common libraries).
3. Install it using default options.
4. Open Anaconda Navigator → Launch Jupyter Notebook
Test it: create a new Python notebook, type print("Hello World") → Run.
✅ If it prints “Hello World”, you’re good.
Tip: Later you’ll use pandas, numpy, matplotlib inside Jupyter for analysis.


2️⃣ Create GitHub Repository
Why: GitHub will store your project, show recruiters you can produce work, and track your progress.
Steps:

1. Go to https://github.com → Sign up or log in.
2. Click “New repository”
3. Name it: oslo-housing-affordability
4. Description: “Analyzing housing prices and affordability in Oslo (2015–2025)”
5. Choose Public → Initialize with README
6. Click Create repository
Next: Clone it to your computer (or use GitHub Desktop):

Download GitHub Desktop
Sign in → Clone repository to your computer → You’ll save notebooks and scripts here


3️⃣ Outline 5 Business Questions
Why: This defines your analysis focus. You can always refine later.
Example Questions (you can copy & adapt):

1. Which districts in Oslo have the highest increase in housing prices (2015–2025)?
2. Are incomes keeping up with housing price growth across districts?
3. Which districts are becoming least affordable for average households?
4. How has inflation affected housing affordability over time?
5. Can we predict next year’s price trends based on historical data?
Tip: Keep them simple, actionable, and data-driven.


4️⃣ Organize Your Workspace

Inside your GitHub repo folder, create subfolders:
·       oslo-housing-affordability/
·           ├── data/        # raw and cleaned datasets
·           ├── notebooks/   # Jupyter notebooks
·           ├── sql/         # SQL scripts
·           ├── dashboard/   # Power BI files
·           └── README.md    # project description
